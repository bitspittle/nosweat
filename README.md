# No Sweat - An Exercise Tracker

This project is a web app that allows creating exercises and workaround routines, as well as running exercises and
tracking your accomplishments.

This project includes both the frontend (web UI for user interactions) and the backend (which maintains the state of the
application for all users).

## Technology

This project uses [Web Compose](https://compose-web.ui.pages.jetbrains.team/) for the frontend, pure Kotlin for the
backend, and [yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) plus [graphql](https://graphql.org/) to communicate between them.
